# Ischooli Cpeg 202 Lab 7

_From class: **CPEG 202**_

## Overview
FPGA/VHDL project targeting the Zybo or similar board.
- Includes VHDL sources, XDC constraints, and (if present) bitstreams.
- Demonstrates combinational/RTL design and board bring-up.

## Build (Vivado)
1. Create a project and add files from `src/` and `constraints/`.
2. Set the correct top entity.
3. Generate bitstream and program the board via Hardware Manager.

## Repo Layout
```
ischooli-cpeg-202-lab-7/
├─ src/
├─ docs/
├─ constraints/   # for FPGA projects
└─ bitstream/     # for FPGA projects
```

## How to Run/Verify
- See docs/* for any PDFs/specs included.
- If no docs, add a short note describing inputs/outputs and expected behavior.

## What I Learned
- Summarize key takeaways: design trade-offs, debugging steps, and test methodology.
